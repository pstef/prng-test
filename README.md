prng-test
=========
### A program for benchmarking and testing pseudo-random generators for use in computer RPGs.

#### What's done:
* I've adapted a few implementations of PRNGs, including Mersenne-Twister, WELL, Xorshift, and Mitchell-Moore
* the program can produce a stream of pseudo-random numbers, which is handy for testing quality of a PRNG with an external program, such as ent or dieharder.

#### Currently supported options:
- h: help
- l: list all generators and exit
- g: select one generator
- b: don't make built-in tests, generate binary instead
- s: use external seed; -s \`date +'%s'\` is a nice example
- n: generate n 32-bit numbers
- o: output to file instead of stdout

#### Currently implemented generators:
* derp - a number generator of extremely poor quality, but fast and, apparently, well distributed
* LGC-k1 - a fast Linear Congruential Generator as described by George Marsaglia
* MM - Mitchell-Moore from The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth
* MMopt - A slightly different implementation of Mitchell-Moore
* MT19937 - Mersenne-Twister
* MWC256 by George Marsaglia
* p_rand - some LGC I know from Jon Lambert
* WELL44497a - Well Equidistributed Long-period Linear, k=44497, no tempering
* WELL44497b - WELL, k=44497, with tempering
* WELL512 - WELL, k=512
* Xorshift-k4 by George Marsaglia
* Xorshift-k5 by George Marsaglia
